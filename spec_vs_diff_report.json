  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features for the Param Shopping marketing app, including a landing page, warm visual theme, and backend marketing content endpoint. However, the backend stores incorrect app content (wrong app name 'Noxium AI' and unrelated features/tagline instead of Param Shopping content), which is a critical issue for REQ-3. All other requirements appear substantially implemented.",

      "requirement": "Backend must store and expose marketing content for Param Shopping including correct app name, tagline, feature list, and CTA text",
      "reason": "The backend in backend/main.mo stores content for a completely different app: appName is 'Noxium AI', tagline is 'AI-powered productivity suite for businesses', and features are 'Automated document processing', 'Smart scheduling', 'Data analysis tools' — none of which relate to Param Shopping. The frontend fallback in useQueries.ts does use 'Param Shopping' but the backend data is wrong.",
