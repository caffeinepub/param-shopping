## Summary
**Goal:** Build a marketing landing page for the "Param Shopping" app with dynamic content served from a backend.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a responsive marketing landing page with hero, features, CTA, and footer sections
- Apply a vibrant e-commerce theme using warm orange/coral accent colors and clean sans-serif typography
- Hero section displays the app name, tagline, and a primary CTA button
- Features section highlights at least 3 key shopping app benefits with icons
- Footer includes "com.paramshopping.app" branding
- Backend exposes a query function returning marketing content (app name, tagline, feature list, CTA label)
